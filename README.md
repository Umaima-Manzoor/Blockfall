## 📌 Overview

**Blockfall** is a Tetris-style desktop game developed in **C++** using **Raylib**.

The project was designed to demonstrate how fundamental **data structures can be implemented from scratch and integrated into a complete interactive application**.

Instead of treating data structures as isolated exercises, each structure has a specific role within the game:

* A **linked list** manages the piece bag and game-board rows.
* A **queue** manages upcoming pieces.
* A **stack** stores previous game states for undo functionality.
* An **AVL tree** organises leaderboard scores.
* A dedicated **PieceQueue** combines multiple structures to manage piece generation.

This makes the project both a playable game and a practical demonstration of data-structure usage.

---

## 👥 Team & Project Context

**Blockfall** originated as a **semester group project for Data Structures and Algorithms**. The original project was developed collaboratively in the repository **Aiman-Misbah/DSA-Project** before being reorganised and continued under this repository.

The original repository separated the team's work into individual directories. Based on that original project structure and its commit history, the main areas of contribution were:

| Team Member | Main Contributions |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| **Aiman** | AVL tree and leaderboard implementation, along with early game and application integration |
| **Maryam** | Queue, PieceQueue, UndoStack, and early game-controller/game integration |
| **Umaima** | Board, LinkedList, pieces, positions, UI components, game integration, and later project restructuring and build/documentation work |

The final version brings these components together into one integrated application rather than keeping the original member-specific folders.

## 🧠 Data Structures

The core of the project is its custom data-structure implementation.

### 1. Linked List — Piece Bag

The piece bag is implemented using a custom **singly linked list**.

Each node stores a `Piece` object and a pointer to the next node.

```text
LinkedList
    │
    ▼
┌─────────────┐
│ Piece       │
│ next ───────┼──────► Piece
└─────────────┘          │
                         ▼
                       Piece
                         │
                         ▼
                        ...
```

The `LinkedList` implementation provides operations for:

* Adding pieces
* Retrieving pieces by index
* Removing pieces
* Checking the current size
* Clearing the list

The list is used by `PieceQueue` as the **piece bag** from which new pieces are selected.

---

### 2. Queue — Upcoming Pieces

A custom **FIFO queue** manages pieces waiting to enter the game.

The queue has a default capacity of **five pieces** and implements standard queue operations:

| Operation   | Purpose                                      |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `enqueue()` | Add a piece to the rear                      |
| `dequeue()` | Remove the piece at the front                |
| `peek()`    | Inspect the front piece                      |
| `isEmpty()` | Check whether the queue is empty             |
| `isFull()`  | Check whether the queue has reached capacity |
| `getSize()` | Return the current number of pieces          |
| `clear()`   | Empty the queue                              |

The queue can also expose its contents for **undo-state restoration** and upcoming-piece display.

---

### 3. PieceQueue — Piece Generation

`PieceQueue` acts as the layer connecting the **piece bag** and the **upcoming-piece queue**.

```text
                 PieceQueue
                     │
             ┌───────┴───────┐
             ▼               ▼
          Queue          LinkedList
             │               │
             ▼               ▼
       Next pieces        Piece bag
```

It is responsible for:

* Filling the initial queue
* Randomly selecting pieces from the bag
* Supplying the next piece to the game
* Providing upcoming pieces for the interface
* Saving the current queue state
* Restoring the queue after an undo

This combines multiple data structures into one gameplay system rather than using them independently.

---

### 4. Linked List — Game Board

The game board uses a separate linked-list structure to represent its rows.

Each `RowNode` contains an array of **15 cells** and a pointer to the next row.

```text
Board
 │
 ▼
Row 0 ──► Row 1 ──► Row 2 ──► ... ──► Row 19
 │          │          │                 │
15 cells  15 cells   15 cells          15 cells
```

The board contains:

* **20 rows**
* **15 columns**
* A linked list of `RowNode` objects

The board implementation provides operations for:

* Adding rows
* Accessing rows
* Detecting completed rows
* Clearing rows
* Checking cell occupancy
* Detecting collisions
* Saving the board state
* Restoring the board state

---

### 5. Stack — Undo System

The undo system follows the **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** principle.

Previous game states are pushed onto a custom stack as the game progresses.

```text
        UndoStack
           │
           ▼
     ┌───────────┐
     │ State 3   │  ← most recent
     ├───────────┤
     │ State 2   │
     ├───────────┤
     │ State 1   │
     └───────────┘
```

When the player performs an undo operation, the most recent saved state is restored first.

Game-state information can include elements such as:

* Board state
* Score
* Current piece
* Upcoming pieces

This allows the game to return to an earlier state rather than simply reversing one individual movement.

---

### 6. AVL Tree — Leaderboard

The leaderboard uses a custom **AVL tree** to organise scores.

An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. After insertions, the tree performs rotations when necessary to maintain its height balance.

```text
              Score
             /     \
          Score    Score
           /          \
        Score        Score
```

The AVL implementation supports:

* Inserting scores
* Maintaining tree balance
* Retrieving high scores
* Managing leaderboard data
* Clearing the tree

Using an AVL tree provides an ordered and balanced structure for score management rather than storing leaderboard entries in an unsorted collection.

---

## 🏗️ Game Architecture

The project is organised into separate layers for gameplay, data structures, leaderboard management, and the user interface.

              │          │                         │
              │          ▼                         │
              │       AVL Tree                     │
              │          │                         │
              └──────────┼─────────────────────────┘

## 🔍 Why Data Structures Matter Here

The data structures in this project are not included merely to demonstrate their syntax. Each one solves a specific problem within the game.

| Structure               | Game System      | Why It Fits                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Linked List**         | Piece bag        | Dynamic sequence of available pieces         |
| **Linked List**         | Board rows       | Sequential row representation                |
| **Queue**               | Upcoming pieces  | FIFO ordering                                |
| **Stack**               | Undo             | Most recent state must be restored first     |
| **AVL Tree**            | Leaderboard      | Maintains ordered, balanced score data       |
| **Combined structures** | Piece generation | Coordinates the piece bag and upcoming queue |

This integration is the main focus of the project: **applying data-structure concepts to real game functionality.**
